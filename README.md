# Punchlist

## Description

**Punchlist** is a lightweight, crossout-style task manager.

This app inspired by, and built for those who use legal pads to aid in their productivity.

A [New York Times article from 1986 citing the Bureau of Census](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/nyregion/the-long-and-short-of-it-yellow-pads-are-thriving.html) claims that **369 million legal pads** were produced the prior year. 

While this number is likely lower today, it's important the environmental impact caused by paper production continues to be reduced.
